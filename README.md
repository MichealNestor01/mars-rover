# Mars Rover Kata

My solution to the [mars rover kata](https://www.codurance.com/katas/mars-rover). Made using TDD and red-green refactor.

I chose to embed the rover's position as a vector and use the 2d rotation matrix to change the direction of the rover. This allows for more directions in the future, and could be added now with use of the parameters of the given execute function.
